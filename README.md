# Google form submitter  

A simple Google form sumitter that takes **three** `fill in` answers and **one** `Radio button` choice *(or at least that is the intention)*.  
It is done for a friend who needed to sumbit a Google form repeatedly in a matter of seconds as he used `AHK` and did not cut it.

# Usage  
Please, it is so simple just have a look at the code...

# Dependencies  
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`
